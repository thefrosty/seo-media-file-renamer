Optimize your media images by renaming the files. It adds a field in the media editor form where you can enter a new file name&sup1;. After renaming it will update the database with the new file name and location. Once complete the plugin will remove all old images included all sizes, ie. (large, medium, thumbnails and all custom image sizes). Once all old images are removed new custom sizes are generated then the plugin looks though all posts and updates any links with the old file URL to the new URL.
